# Suspend & Resume

A task can **pause mid-run to ask a human for input**, then continue once the form is filled in. Call `dicode.suspend({ schema })`: the run ends as `suspended`, dicode collects the input via the web UI or the `dicode resume` CLI, validates it against the schema, and the task runs again -- this time with the answers in hand, dispatched to a **resume handler you export** so you never hand-write an `if (state)` switch.

Use it for approval gates, multi-step wizards, "which of these do you mean?" disambiguation, or any step that can't proceed without a person.

The form is described with a **[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org)** (draft 2020-12). That's a standard, portable vocabulary: the same schema drives the default web UI form, the CLI prompts, and the **server-side validation** that guarantees `ctx.input` conforms before your task re-runs.

::: tip Supported runtimes: Deno and Python only
`dicode.suspend()` is granted automatically to Deno and Python tasks -- it needs no `permissions.dicode` declaration. Docker and Podman tasks cannot suspend; see [Runtime scope](#runtime-scope).
:::

## The model -- re-run, not freeze

Suspend is **not** VM-style suspension. Nothing sits frozen in memory.

1. The task calls `dicode.suspend(...)`.
2. dicode records the carried `state` blob and the `schema`, then the process **exits cleanly** (exit code 0). The run row is marked `suspended`.
3. When someone submits the form, dicode **validates the submission against the schema**, then starts a **brand-new process** for the same task and re-runs the script **from the top**.
4. On that re-run, the runner **dispatches the right handler** and hands it `ctx.state` (the blob you carried) and `ctx.input` (the submitted values).

Because the whole file re-runs from the top, any side effect at module top level runs again on every resume -- keep top-level code idempotent and put real work inside a handler. You don't write a step switch yourself; the runner picks the handler for you (see [Auto-dispatch](#the-handlers-auto-dispatch) below).

A first (non-resume) run sees `ctx.state` as `undefined` (Deno) / `None` (Python) inside `main`; a resumed handler sees the real carried blob.

## `dicode.suspend(req)`

Pauses the run. It records `req` over IPC, then **never returns** -- internally it throws a control signal that the runtime catches to exit the process cleanly. Code written after `suspend()` in the same function does not run on the suspending pass; it runs on the resume pass instead, inside whichever handler the runner dispatches to.

::: code-group

```ts [Deno]
interface SuspendRequest {
  schema: JSONSchema;  // JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for the input to collect
  to?: string;         // name of the steps[] handler to run on resume (wizard shape)
  state?: unknown;      // JSON-serializable blob carried to the resume as ctx.state
  deadline?: number;    // optional Unix-ms instant; resumable until then (default 24h)
}

await dicode.suspend(req: SuspendRequest): Promise<never>
```

```python [Python]
dicode.suspend(schema=<dict>, to=<str>, state=<json>, deadline=<unix_ms>)
```

:::

- **`to`** names the `steps` handler to dispatch on resume -- the wizard shape. Omit it for the two-function (`main` + `resume`) shape.
- **`state`** is your own carried blob, handed back as `ctx.state` on the resume. The runner persists it wrapped with an internal step marker (so first-vs-resume stays unambiguous) -- you never see or manage that marker yourself.
- **`deadline`** is an optional Unix-ms instant; the run stays resumable until then. Omit it (or pass `0`) for the default **24-hour** window.

## The handlers -- auto-dispatch

You export handlers; the runner decides which one runs based on the resume:

| You export | First run | Resume |
|---|---|---|
| `main` only | `main` | `main` again -- branch on `ctx.state` by hand |
| `main` + `resume` | `main` | `resume` |
| `main` + `steps` map | `main` | `steps[to]` -- the handler named by `suspend({ to })` |

`main` is always the entry (first) step. Each handler receives the resume context -- in **Deno**, destructure the argument (`async function resume({ state, input, dicode })`); in **Python**, read the module-global `ctx` (`ctx.state`, `ctx.input`) or accept it as an argument (`async def resume(ctx):`).

| | First run | Resume run |
|---|---|---|
| `ctx.state` | `undefined` / `None` | the `state` you passed to `suspend()` (unwrapped) |
| `ctx.input` | the trigger input | the submitted values, keyed by property name |

`ctx.input` on a resume is validated against the schema before your task re-runs, and its values arrive with the **declared JSON types** -- a `number`/`integer` property is a number, a `boolean` is a bool. Coerce defensively anyway.

::: warning `suspend({ to })` must name a real step
If `to` names a handler that isn't present in the exported `steps` map (a typo, or a step removed while a run was mid-wizard), the resume **fails loudly** with a clear error rather than silently falling back to `main`/`resume`. The single-`main` and `main` + `resume` shapes, which export no `steps` map, are unaffected.
:::

## The form -- JSON Schema

`schema` is a JSON Schema object describing the input object the user fills in. Server-side validation rejects a submission that doesn't conform (web UI: `400` with the failing property; CLI: a clear error) before the task resumes.

The daemon compiles the schema the moment you call `dicode.suspend`, so a malformed schema surfaces as an error to the task **immediately** -- while it can still react -- instead of silently suspending and then failing every resume attempt. External or `file://` `$ref`s are refused; a suspend schema must be self-contained.

Use an `object` schema whose `properties` are the fields to collect:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "object",
  "title": "Deploy", // heading shown above the form
  "description": "Pick a target.", // sub-text under the title
  "properties": {
    "project": { "type": "string", "title": "Project name" },
    "notes": { "type": "string", "title": "Notes", "format": "textarea" },
    "count": { "type": "integer", "title": "How many?", "default": 10 },
    "notify": { "type": "boolean", "title": "Send a notification?", "default": true },
    "env": { "type": "string", "title": "Environment", "enum": ["staging", "prod"] }
  },
  "required": ["project", "env"]
}
```

### What the default renderer maps

The built-in web UI form renders the common JSON Schema subset with zero author effort. Each property in `properties` becomes one control:

| Schema | Control |
|---|---|
| `type: "string"` | text input |
| `type: "string"`, `format: "textarea"` (or `"multiline"`) | textarea |
| `enum: [...]` (any type) | select |
| `type: "boolean"` | checkbox |
| `type: "number"` / `"integer"` | number input |

Honored keywords: `title` (label -- falls back to the property name), `description` (help text), `default` (pre-filled value), `enum` (choices), and the top-level `required` array (marks a field required and drives missing-field validation). Standard constraint keywords (`minimum`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, ...) are enforced by the server-side validator even when the default renderer has no special widget for them.

## Worked example -- a two-step wizard (`steps`)

Collect a project name, then a target environment, then finish. `suspend({ to })` names the next handler; the runner dispatches it and hands it `ctx.input` (the submission) and `ctx.state` (the blob you carried). No step switch to write.

::: code-group

```ts [Deno]
export default async function main({ dicode }: DicodeSdk) {
  // First run -- ask for the project name, resume into the "env" step.
  await dicode.suspend({
    to: "env",
    schema: {
      type: "object",
      title: "New project",
      description: "What should we call it?",
      properties: { project: { type: "string", title: "Project name" } },
      required: ["project"],
    },
  });
  // unreachable -- suspend() never returns
}

export const steps = {
  // Runs on the first resume: the name is in ctx.input; ask for the
  // environment, carrying the name forward in state.
  async env({ dicode, input }: DicodeSdk) {
    await dicode.suspend({
      to: "finish",
      state: { name: input.project },
      schema: {
        type: "object",
        title: `Deploy ${input.project}`,
        properties: {
          env: { type: "string", title: "Target environment", enum: ["staging", "prod"] },
        },
        required: ["env"],
      },
    });
  },
  // Runs on the second resume: both answers in hand; finish.
  async finish({ state, input }: DicodeSdk) {
    return { project: state.name, env: input.env ?? "staging" };
  },
};
```

```python [Python]
async def main():
    # First run -- ask for the project name, resume into the "env" step.
    dicode.suspend(
        to="env",
        schema={
            "type": "object",
            "title": "New project",
            "description": "What should we call it?",
            "properties": {"project": {"type": "string", "title": "Project name"}},
            "required": ["project"],
        },
    )
    # unreachable -- suspend() raises and the process exits


async def env(ctx):
    # First resume: the name is in ctx.input; ask for the environment,
    # carrying the name forward in state.
    dicode.suspend(
        to="finish",
        state={"name": ctx.input["project"]},
        schema={
            "type": "object",
            "title": f"Deploy {ctx.input['project']}",
            "properties": {
                "env": {"type": "string", "title": "Target environment", "enum": ["staging", "prod"]},
            },
            "required": ["env"],
        },
    )


async def finish(ctx):
    # Second resume: both answers in hand; finish.
    return {"project": ctx.state["name"], "env": ctx.input.get("env", "staging")}


steps = {"env": env, "finish": finish}
```

:::

Each `suspend()` mints its own resume, so a task can suspend any number of times -- chaining wizard steps together, one named handler per pause.

## Simpler -- ask once, then finish (`resume`)

When you only pause once, skip the `steps` map: export `main` and `resume`. The runner runs `main` on the first pass and `resume` on the continuation.

::: code-group

```ts [Deno]
export default async function main({ dicode }: DicodeSdk) {
  await dicode.suspend({
    schema: {
      type: "object",
      title: "Approve deploy?",
      properties: { ok: { type: "boolean", title: "Ship it?" } },
      required: ["ok"],
    },
  });
}

export async function resume({ input }: DicodeSdk) {
  return { shipped: input.ok };
}
```

```python [Python]
async def main():
    dicode.suspend(
        schema={
            "type": "object",
            "title": "Approve deploy?",
            "properties": {"ok": {"type": "boolean", "title": "Ship it?"}},
            "required": ["ok"],
        },
    )


async def resume(ctx):
    return {"shipped": ctx.input.get("ok")}
```

:::

A task that exports **only `main`** still works: on resume the runner re-runs `main`, and you branch on `ctx.state` by hand (`undefined`/`None` on the first run, your carried blob on the resume). Pass a `state` when you go this route so the two passes are distinguishable.

## Try the shipped example

dicode-core ships a ready-to-run wizard under [`tasks/examples/suspend-wizard/`](https://github.com/dicode-ayo/dicode-core/tree/main/tasks/examples/suspend-wizard) -- a manually-triggered, three-step "new project" wizard built on the `steps` map and the JSON Schema resume form. It's the same shape as the worked example above, one hop longer, and the easiest way to copy-paste your way into a wizard of your own.

1. In the web UI, open the **Suspend Wizard (example)** task and **Run** it. The run immediately goes `suspended` and its detail page renders a form.
2. **Step 1 -- Project name.** `main` suspends `to: "chooseFramework"`, asking for a `project_name` (string, required). Fill it in and submit.
3. **Step 2 -- Framework.** `chooseFramework` reads the name from `ctx.input`, carries it in `state`, and suspends `to: "confirm"`, asking for a `framework` (an `enum` of `deno` / `node` / `bun`, rendered as a select).
4. **Step 3 -- Confirm.** `confirm` suspends `to: "summarize"` with a `confirmed` boolean (a checkbox), carrying name + framework forward.
5. **Finish.** `summarize` returns `{ project, framework, confirmed }` -- the run ends `resumed` and the continuation's result shows on its run detail page.

Each pause auto-renders from the schema, so there's no form code to write; the runner dispatches the next handler by the `to` name with no step switch. The same flow works from the CLI: `dicode resume` lists the suspended run, and `dicode resume <run-id> project_name=acme` (etc.) submits each step in turn.

## Rules and gotchas

- **`state` must be JSON-serializable.** It's persisted as JSON, so functions, class instances, `Map`/`Set`, and the like won't survive the round trip. Keep it to plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and booleans.
- **Never swallow the suspend signal.** `suspend()` throws (Deno) / raises (Python) a control signal *after* the payload is recorded; the runtime wrapper catches it to end the run cleanly. If your own `try`/`catch` (or bare `except:`) swallows it and the task keeps running or returns normally, the wrapper detects the contradiction -- a run that both suspended and returned -- and **fails the run loudly**. Don't wrap `suspend()` in a catch-all, or re-throw the signal if you must catch broadly.
- **`params` survive a resume; the original trigger input does not.** The continuation is a fresh run that restores the suspended run's `params` (so `ctx.params` is unchanged). On a resume, `ctx.input` is the **form submission**, not the payload that fired the *original* run (the webhook body, the chain payload) -- that isn't replayed. Stash anything you'll need from the original input into `state` before you suspend.
- **`deadline` is optional.** Omit it (or pass `0`) for the default **24-hour** window. Once the deadline lapses, the sweep cancels the run (status `cancelled`, fail reason `resume_timeout`) and any later resume attempt is rejected.
- **A suspended run resumes exactly once.** The resume handle is single-use and consumed atomically -- a second resume of the same run fails with "already resumed".

## Runtime scope

Suspend/resume is supported on the **Deno and Python** runtimes only. Docker and Podman tasks cannot suspend -- a container runtime runs an opaque image and has no way to intercept a mid-execution pause request and read the payload back, so granting the capability there would let a suspend attempt be silently dropped instead. Calling `dicode.suspend()` from a Docker/Podman task fails with a permission-denied error.

Unlike the rest of `dicode.*`, this isn't something you opt into per task with a `permissions.dicode` flag -- the capability is granted automatically based on the task's `runtime:`. See [Tasks -- Permissions](./tasks.md#permissions).

## Lifecycle and statuses

```
running --suspend()--> suspended --resume--> resumed        (terminal)
                            |
                            +--deadline lapse--> cancelled   (fail_reason: resume_timeout)
```

| Status | Terminal? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `suspended` | no | Paused awaiting input. `finished_at` stays `NULL`. |
| `resumed` | yes | The resume handle was consumed and a continuation run was spawned. Set exactly once. |
| `cancelled` (`resume_timeout`) | yes | The `deadline` lapsed before anyone resumed. |

The **continuation is a new run** with its own run ID, taken through the normal execution path -- which is why it can suspend again. The original suspended run does not itself "become" the continuation; it transitions to `resumed`, and the continuation carries on from the handler the runner dispatches, with `ctx.state` restored.

## How to resume

### Web UI

Open the suspended run's detail page. It renders a form from the JSON Schema the task declared; fill it in and submit. That posts the collected values to `/api/runs/{runID}/resume`, which **validates them against the stored schema** and spawns the continuation run. The raw resume handle is resolved server-side from the stored run -- the browser session (or API key) is the authorization, not a client-supplied secret.

### CLI

List what's waiting (the `FIELDS` column shows the schema's required properties):

```console
$ dicode resume
RUN ID                               TASK                     SUSPENDED AT         FIELDS
b1c2...                              examples/suspend-wizard   2026-07-08T09:12:00Z project_name
```

Resume interactively -- dicode reads the schema and prompts for each property, honoring its type, `enum` choices, `required`, and `default`:

```console
$ dicode resume b1c2...
Project name (required): acme-api
resumed: continuation run 7f8a...
```

Or pass the answers as `field=value` pairs -- each value is coerced to the property's declared type and validated against the schema before submit:

```console
$ dicode resume b1c2... project_name=acme-api
resumed: continuation run 7f8a...
follow: dicode logs 7f8a...
```

The continuation runs asynchronously; follow it with `dicode logs <run-id>`.
